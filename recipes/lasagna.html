            <h2>How to make lasagna</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350℉. Prepare a 9×13 baking dish by spraying with cooking spray. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Cook pasta to “al dente” according to package directions. Drain and set aside.</li>
                <li>Add ground beef, onion, and garlic to a Dutch oven or deep-walled skillet. Cook until ground beef is browned and cooked through and onions are softened. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Add marinara and beef broth and simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>While sauce is simmering, in a separate bowl, whisk ricotta and egg together until smooth. Stir in 1 cup of mozzarella and ¼ cup Parmesan. Season with salt and pepper to taste and set aside.</li>
                <li>When sauce is done cooking, remove from heat and stir in cooked pasta and fresh basil.
</li>
                <li>Pour half of the pasta/sauce mixture into the prepared baking dish. Spoon ricotta mixture evenly over the pasta and gently spread to even out, then add the remaining pasta/sauce mixture.</li>
                <li>Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Top with remaining cheeses and bake, uncovered for an additional 5 minutes or until cheese is melted. Serve hot.</li>
